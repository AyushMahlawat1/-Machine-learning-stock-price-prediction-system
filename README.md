Certainly! Here's a detailed yet clear README.md file for your Flask-based stock price prediction project using LSTM:

# Stock Price Prediction Web App

This project is a Flask web application that predicts stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. It takes historical stock data CSV files as input, trains an LSTM model on the training data, and predicts future stock prices on test data. The app returns predictions along with evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, and accuracy.

---

## Features

- Upload training and testing CSV files containing stock prices.
- Uses LSTM layers with dropout to capture time series dependencies and avoid overfitting.
- Data preprocessing includes scaling and sequence creation for time-series forecasting.
- Outputs predicted stock prices alongside actual prices for comparison.
- Provides evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and custom accuracy.
- Simple web interface powered by Flask for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. Upload your training and testing CSV files. Make sure each CSV contains a `Close` column with stock closing prices.

4. Click **Predict** to get the predicted stock prices and evaluation metrics.

---

## File Format

* Both training and testing CSV files must include a `Close` column representing the closing prices.
* Values in the `Close` column should be numeric. Non-numeric values will cause an error.
* Training data should contain at least 60 records for the model to learn temporal patterns.

---

## Model Details

* **Model Architecture:**

  * Two LSTM layers (64 units and 32 units) with dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
  * Dense layers for output prediction.
* **Training:**

  * 15 epochs with batch size 32.
  * Adam optimizer with mean squared error loss.

## Error Handling

The app provides clear JSON error messages for issues like missing files, missing columns, non-numeric data, or insufficient training data length. Detailed error logs are printed to the server console for debugging.

## Dependencies

* Flask
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow (Keras)
